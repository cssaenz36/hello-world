# hello-world
Introduction project to Github. Will explore essentials like making a new repository, creating branches, and making a pull request.

A little bit about myself! My name is Christopher, I'm a student at Stanford University studying Engineering Physics with a focus on Aerospace Science. My senior year has been the first year where I take Aero Astro classes. Luckily for me, the classes have been a delightful challenge. I feel more motivated than ever to finish my studies and receive a degree in engineering from Stanford University!
